## Subject : The Financial Challenge

**The technical challenge is split into two parts, each of them evaluated separately although a strong
performance in each of them is required in order to get to the final of the Datathon.
Although, as we have already seen, there may be more than one transition moment, for this challenge we
will focus only on the first transition from growth to maturity.**


- Part 1: Predict transition moment

Predict if there will be a transition to maturity happening for each of the brands during the defined time
period, which is in the upcoming 37 months. In case there is, it is important to provide a prediction as to
when it will happen.


- Part 2: Predict stabilization upon transition

Provide the sales forecast for the same forecasting horizon. Adjust the benchmark forecast, which will be
provided to you, based on the expected transition point in time from the first part.
